<h2>Modern vs Ancient Road Comparison</h2>
<h3>Do modern major Italian roads follow the same paths as ancient Roman major roads? How much deviation has occurred over the last 2,000 years?</h3>
<h5>As an archaeology major with an interest in the classical world, I think comparisons between ancient and modern ways of life are particularly interesting. Due to Italy's arguably complicated geography (being a peninsula with the Apennine Mountains running down the middle) and the technical building skills applied in Roman road construction, I was curious to see how much the major pathways through Italy have changed over the last 2,000 years. Looking at my map, one can see that many major modern roads (seen in dark green) follow ancient routes (seen in brown) closely, in some cases almost perfectly. </h5>

<h5>I sourced my original data set on ancient Roman roads from the Ancient World Mapping Center (AMWC), located here at UNC.</h5>

<h2>Difference: Isolating the Lazio Region of Modern Italy</h2>
<p></p> <h5>The Shapefile of Italy that I downloaded from Princeton University included the different provinces/regions present in the country. Since I was only looking for the province that included the modern city of Rome (Lazio), I did a difference to single out Lazio and create a layer with only that province. The Lazio province is highlighted in yellow in the map below. </h5>
