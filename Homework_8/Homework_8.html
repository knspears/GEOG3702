<h2>Modern vs Ancient Road Comparison</h2>
<h3>Do modern major Italian roads follow the same paths as ancient Roman major roads? How much deviation has occurred over the last 2,000 years?</h3>
<h5>As an archaeology major with an interest in the classical world, I think comparisons between ancient and modern ways of life are particularly interesting. Due to Italy's arguably complicated geography (being a peninsula with the Apennine Mountains running down the middle) and the technical building skills applied in Roman road construction, I was curious to see how much the major pathways through Italy have changed over the last 2,000 years. Looking at my map, one can see that many major modern roads (seen in dark green) follow ancient routes (seen in brown) closely -- particularly the roads in the central and northern parts of the country -- and match them almost exactly in certain instances. </h5>

<h5>I sourced my original data set on ancient Roman roads from the Ancient World Mapping Center (AMWC), located here at UNC. It is important to note here that both of my roads data sets (the ancient and modern) were cleaned prior to any geoprocessing to only include the roads deemed "major" or "primary" as defined by the data sets themselves.</h5>
<h1>Vector Analysis: Actions Performed</h1>

<h2>Difference: Isolating the Lazio Region of Modern Italy</h2>
<p></p> <h5>The Shapefile of Italy that I downloaded from Princeton University included the different provinces/regions present in the country. Since I was only looking for the province that included the modern city of Rome (Lazio), I did a difference to single out Lazio and create a layer with only that province. The Lazio province is highlighted in yellow in the map below. </h5>
<h2>Dissolve: A Unified Italy</h2>
<h5>As mentioned above, the Shapefile of Italy that I originally downloaded included all of the various provinces/regions in the country, which looked extremely messy when I later went to add my other layers (which were also lines so it was way too many lines on a small country). Because I didn't actually need the provinces (aside from Lazio, which I had already singled out), I went ahead and "got rid" of them by completing a dissolve and merging all of the province data into one. This resulted in the clean image of Italy you see below in the map (and the layer is shown in light green).</h5>

<h2>Intersection: Only the Ancient Roads in Italy</h2>
<h5>The AWMC's ancient roads Shapefile included all of the (known) Roman roads through its empire, which spanned nearly the entirety of the Mediterranean at one point. While this was a lot of really cool information (especially to see how much work the Romans put into putting infrastructure in to link its many colonies), I only needed the roads that are located in modern-day Italy. To size down this data, I completed an intersection between my ancient roads layer and my (dissolved) Italy layer to yield all of the Roman roads within modern Italian borders (these can be seen in brown on the map). </h5>
