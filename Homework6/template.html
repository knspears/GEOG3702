    <h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth</h1>
    <h2>Kathryn Spears</h2>
    <h3>My map looks at how many people per 1,000 used food stamps in the state of Wisconsin in 2019. I chose to display the data as per 1,000 people rather than the raw numbers (which is what the dataset I downloaded gave me) because it was difficult to find a classification mode that accurately and neatly displayed the data. As someone who isn't entirely familiar with the populations of Wisconsin counties (I have family there so I have a rough idea as to where the more urban areas are), it was difficult for me to be able to tell whether or not a county had a high percentage of people using food stamps, so displaying the data as per 1000 people gave a clearer picture of food stamp usage because it put it in the context of the county's population. Additionally, the dataset had numbers in the tens of thousands, which can be kind of difficult to look at/read in a legend, so changing the display to per 1000 people made the legend look a little cleaner. My data was sourced from census.data.gov and was collected by the American Community Survey. </h3>
