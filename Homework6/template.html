    <h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth</h1>
    <h2>Kathryn Spears</h2>
    <h3>My map looks at how many people per 1,000 used food stamps in the state of Wisconsin in 2019. I chose to display the data as per 1,000 people rather than the raw numbers (which is what the dataset I downloaded gave me) because it was difficult to find a classification mode that accurately and neatly displayed the data. Additionally, the dataset had numbers in the tens of thousands, which can be kind of difficult to look at/read in a legend, so changing the display to per 1000 people made the legend look a little cleaner. My data was sourced from census.data.gov and was collected by the American Community Survey. </h3>
