    <h3>Homework 5: Georeferenced Historical Image</h3>
    <h5>This is a georeferenced image of a section of Garner, NC (my hometown). During the 1950s, the NCDOT re-routed a local highway (HWY 70) further south through much of the existing town. I've always been curious to see exactly how the construction of that highway impacted the original town layout, so I chose to georeference an aerial image from 1950 to see the differences.</h5>
