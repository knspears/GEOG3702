    <h1>A note before we begin...</h1>
    <h2>While attempting to complete the ratio for my choropleth I realized that I used the wrong data from the CSV that I downloaded from census.data.gov. In my original choropleth I used the total number of households in each Wisconsin county in place of the number of households that used food stamps in 2019, resulting in my numbers being much larger than they should have been. After trying to rationalize it against population data for each country, I realized my error when the counties were reporting that 70-80% of the households were using food stamps, which is incorrect (the actual figure is closer to ~15% for the entire state of WI). Long story short, I went back and fixed my original choropleth to show the number of households that used food stamps in 2019 so I could complete the second part of this assignment correctly. </h2>
