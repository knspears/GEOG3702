    <h1>Homework 7: South Carolina Choropleth</h1>
    <h4>The choropleth below shows the number of fatalities per county in South Carolina in the year 2019.</h4>
    <h5>Using data sourced from the US Department of Transportation (see below), this choropleth shows the number of recorded fatalities from car crashes in 2019 per county. The darker the color of the county, the higher the number of fatalities in that county. I did not choose to rationalize my data against population data because the numbers I was using from the USDOT were so small that any attempt to rationalize the data resulted in my ratio values being in the tens of thousandths of decimal places -- which didn't show up well on the choropleth. Because of this, it's important to consider where South Carolina's urban areas are when looking at the choropleth because there is a higher number of fatalities in the counties with higher populations (the dark green counties). All of the dark green counties (53+ fatalities) include the state's most populated areas/cities, including Charleston, Myrtle Beach, and Greenville. If this data were to be rationalized, the ratio of fatalities to total population would likely take those counties/areas out of the highest classification category. Additionally, it's worth noting that the counties found along I-95 tend to have more recorded fatalities than those that don't have the interstate pass through it because more people (both local and traveling) use those counties' roads, so it makes sense that there would be a higher number of fatal accidents there. </h5>
    <h5>I chose to work with car accident + fatality data because it's an issue that we tend to hear about a lot in the news (at least I often see it in the local news), but it's unfortunately something that's so "common" that it often gets overlooked by the people who aren't directly affected by it. I usually see an article a day in the local news about a fatal accident, but I rarely see any sort of reports on yearly totals and/or averages. 
    <h5>In terms of choosing South Carolina over other states, I just let my roommate pick because she's from South Carolina. I didn't do the US as a whole because the CSV my dataset was in was originally 85,000+ lines long in Excel and I didn't even know where to start with cleaning that much data. If I had more time however, I'd be interested in looking at the rates around the country. </h5>
