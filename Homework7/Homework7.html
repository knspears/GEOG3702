    <h1>Homework 7: South Carolina Choropleth</h1>
    <h4>The choropleth below shows the number of fatalities per county in South Carolina in the year 2019.</h4>
    <h5>Using data sourced from the US Department of Transportation (see below), this choropleth shows the number of recorded fatalities from car crashes in 2019 per county. The darker the color of the county, the higher the number of fatalities in that county.</h5>
    <h5>I did not choose to rationalize my data against population data because the numbers I was using from the USDOT were so small that any attempt to rationalize the data resulted in my ratio values being in the tens of thousandths of decimal places -- which didn't show up well on the choropleth. Because of this, it's important to consider where South Carolina's urban areas are when looking at the choropleth because there is a higher number of fatalities in the counties with higher populations (the dark green counties). All of the dark green counties (53+ fatalities) include the state's most populated areas/cities, including Charleston, Myrtle Beach, and Greenville. If this data were to be rationalized, the ratio of fatalities to total population would likely take those counties/areas out of the highest classification category. </h5>
